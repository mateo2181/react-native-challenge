# React Native Challenge

## Requirements
In our company ELGOOG, we have a new client who, as a Rick and Morty fan, want to be able to have all the information about the characters in a mobile app.

The client provide us a list of requirements that he wants to see in the app:
 - A Main screen with the list of characters showing: 
      - image
      - species
      - location
 - Add a field at the top of the Main screen to filter by name. 
 - When a character is selected, a Detail screen should be opened showing:
      - image
      - species
      - gender
      - status
      - how many episodes the character has been part of?

## Technical considerations
- The app should be developed using React Native (use ```create-react-native-app``` is valid).
- The API to consume is https://rickandmortyapi.com, feel free to choose between REST or GraphQL.
- For styling you can use whatever you have more experience with: StyleSheet, CSS Modules, Chakra UI, etc.
- Libraries to handle navigation and state management will be considered.
- Consider that the app can has new features in the future, so the way the project and the files are organized is important in order to create a maintainable app.


The task can be done forking this repository or creating a new one.

Once the task is finished, please send the Github repository to a member of our team.
